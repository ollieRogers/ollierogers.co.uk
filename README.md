=================

The source for [my website](http://www.ollierogers.co.uk "ollierogers.co.uk"). Runs on node.js. 

If you aren't running node you can install it here [node.js](http://www.node.org "node project").

Once node is up and running clone this repo.

`cd` to the directory you cloned to. Then run `npm install` to install all project dependencies.

Finally run `node app` to run the site in production and go to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser of choice.

In development run `NODE_ENV=development node app`.

Alternatively if you have [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon "nodemon by Remy Sharp") installed then run `NODE_ENV=development nodemon app.js` to run the site in development mode.
